I created an app that displays "Hello World!" in every language I've ever studied (English, German, French, Chinese, Latin). There are buttons with the flags of different countries where the language is spoken. If you click a button, then the leader of that country appears with a speech bubble. Inside the speech bubble is a translation of "Hello World!" in the specified language. For example, if you click on the flag of Germany, Angela Merkel appears with a speech bubble saying "Hallo Welt!".
